What Is Bean Cash?
------------------

Bean Cash (Ticker: BITB) is a re-brand of BitBean. Bean Cash brings
forward BitBean's legacy of lightening-fast transactions and a
rock-solid network, with a mature blockchain--that is nearly 5 years
old! 5 years is a long time in the "crypto-currency" space! In this
time, Beancash has not hardforked or had a transaction roll-back. Bean
Cash is developed by Bean Core, a virtual company comprised of
individuals and entities around the world, with the purpose of moving
development forward and helping to bring about consensus among the
community. Bean Cash's mission: "To be an enduring digital currency,
with high integrity, a store of value and a means of exchange of value
in every day transactions -- that stands the test of time!"

Bean Cash is a digital currency and network, designed for scalability,
speed, and lightening fast transactions! It features an innovative Proof
of Bean (PoB) algorithm that more closely resembles traditional Proof of
Work (PoW) crypto currencies. Bean Cash is the first digital currency to
implement a maximum of 20MB blocks, based off Gavin Andersen's proposals
to fix Bitcoin's scalability limitations. Bean Cash is designed from the
ground-up to be a transaction-centric and superior form of currency, for
exchange of value in on-line purchases (idealy suited for
micro-transactions) and purchases with traditional brick-and-mortar
merchants.

In it's mission to be a transaction-centric digital currency with real
world use, one of the goals for Bean Cash, is solving the "last mile
issue" in the digital currency space. Specifically, the "last mile
issue" deals with implimentation of infrastructure at the point of use.
Instramental in this objective will be working with companies that are
willing to implement Bean Cash at the Point of Sale/Service. Bean Cash
is designed to support a network with over 1,300 TPS (Transactions Per
Second), effecively being able to compete with companies such as PayPal.

As developers of Bean Cash, we are not looking to re-impliment a
transaction system, based on the "Check/Cheque" model (et al. Bitcoin),
where a merchant approves a transaction based on simple verification,
and settlement happens much latter. That kind of model does not provide
any more value than existing, charge back prone, credit cards.

Rather than use archaic models of the past, Bean Cash will allow
merchants to verify, validate and settle transactions in near real time
(a minute or less on average for a single confirmation transaction.)
This is magnitudes faster than Bitcoin (10-30 times, or substantually
more if transactions are back-logged), while providing no risk, with
transactions being posted in near real time to the Bean Cash blockchain.
This provides real value by allowing merchants to reduce risk, fraud,
and costs as their percentage of Bean Cash transactions increases in
their business. Fundamently, a zero confirmation transaction does not
help to solve a real-world problem, as merchants still bear risk as with
existing traditional payment methods (checks/cheques/Credit-Debit
cards).
