Intro
-----
Beancash is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPBean and Novacoin, innovations such as
Proof-of-Sprout and Proof-of-Sprout Transactions (PoST), help further advance
the field of crypto-currency.
